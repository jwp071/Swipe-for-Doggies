# Swipe for Doggies

Simple project to teach myself how to utilize a public API parsing JSON data in an Android app. This app uses the random.dog API to retrieve images and videos of dogs then display them to an app user. By scrolling to the left or up, a new image or video will be retrieved and loaded.
